| May09 | 7    |           Went through the research papers and looked into loading datasets directly through sftp. Looked at the feasibility of working with the data set on local jupyter notebooks. Prepared and presented the final deck for week 1. Picked 'Barley' and performed initial EDA on the data sets                              |
| May10 | 6     |   Continued with the initial EDA and wrangling. Merged the data sets together. Added more questions related to the data to the questions document. Studied on Deep learning                                   |
| May11 | 6     |                         Went through another research paper. Learned more on the terminologies used in remote sensing data.   Discussed the reasearch paper and questions in the team meeting.               |
| May12 | 6     |              Attended the client meeting. Got the updated dataset from the client. Gained more context on the data and the required next steps. Did initial wrangling on the new dataset.                         |
| May13 | 5     |             Performed EDA on the new datasets.                              |
