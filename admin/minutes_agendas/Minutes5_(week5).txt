For those eco-districts that have less number of records, we can combine them and cast all those values.
(This could be done at the client's end). But we are not doing this. Just leaving those eco-districts.         
  
If we create models for each of the eco districts, 
we expect high accuracy when we have high rows and vice-versa. 


We'll run all of them regardless of the rows.    

Ultimate goal is to get high accuracy.     
For each eco-district we need one model.      

* Apply models and look when accuracy is decreasing. 

* Reduce number of variables by using Feature selection models we have, 
and then apply Deep Learning models.      

* Deep learning models will take care of relationships among variables. 

* Results: Results of each model, and compare each model as well. 
* Conclusions. 

* Deliverables: 
- Tables and scripts from us. 
Output table with additional field, and the accuracy for that forecast, based on townships, eco-districts, and year. 
(To bring it back to GIS)
- Scripts of code.     
  

* Year is also a good predictor, as trend of the crop goes up by years. 
Not important even if we remove it as we only have it as 11 years. Otherwise it is a good predictor. 
Explains 70%-80% variance.            
Year plays important role as technology advances. 
We can do both use it as well as drop it. Normalizing it as well.
We have decided to not use it.   

* If the accuracy suddenly drops, we can say that below this number, the accuracy suddenly drops and we take is as the threshold. 
So we can stop there and use it as a threshold.    

* Scree plot can be created in PCA.    

Also, a plot showing the the trend for eco-districts and accuracy.
