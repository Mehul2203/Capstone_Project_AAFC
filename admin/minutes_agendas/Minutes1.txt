Minutes of the Meeting 1:

Objective - Crop yield forecasting model. Uses dataset for modelling based on climate based, time series, recorded yield, use machine learning method in python (Neural Network method mostly)
Use the model to forecast the expected variables - yield - dependent variable
Can tell the expected yield for this year using the model
First test the model on one crop and then on another crop
How to transfer data to Data science team? Maybe via FTP/SFTP - Onus on the client
We need to see which variables can be added or included in the model

Overview of the Dataset:
Township - Area or the modelling unit, 10*10 KM
Area - Manitoba, Saskachuan - where the data is
10 years of the historical data
Important variable is climate change 1985 - 2020
Soil moisture is naother one 2010 - 2020
Evaporative Stress Index 2019-20
Client Recommendation is to use 3 week average
We need to work with spatial data or geographical data
If GIS knowledge, it should be better, 
if not, need to include map variables - some township ID for the model to work in tabular format, 
need to revert to the customer if we are fine with GIS approach and fetch predictors and they help 
us in creating the GIS into tabular format
Darker township represent higher yield

Ecodistricts - Environments which can be taken into use for predictors
